@Matthew Good morning, Washington Grade School, this is Chris. How may I help you?
@Joanna Good morning, this is Alice Smith, I'm calling for my daughter, Judy. She's not feeling well today.
@Matthew I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it's not too bad.
@Kimberly No, no she has a little fever and a cough. Nothing too serious.
@Matthew Well, I hope she feels well soon.
@Joanna Thank you. Do you think I could get her homework for today?
@Matthew Is there any specific class?
@Joanna I'm especially concerned about math and science.
@Kimberly OK, is it all right for me to give your email address to the teachers? They can then send the homework along later today.
@Justin That would be great. Do you have my e-mail on file?
@Kevin Just a moment... We have chrisp ad gmail.com. Is that correct?
@Justin Yes, that is correct.
@Kevin OK, I'll make sure Mr. Brown and Ms. White get your message and email.
@Ivy Thank you very much.
@Joey I hope Judy feels well soon.
@Justin She should be fine by tomorrow. Thanks for your help.
@Joey My pleasure, have a nice day.
@Ivy Thank you. Goodbye.
@Joey Goodbye.
